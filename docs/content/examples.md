# Examples

Here are some examples on how to easily deploy Maesh on your cluster.

??? Note "Prerequisites"
    Before following those examples, make sure your cluster follows [the prerequisites for deploying Maesh](quickstart.md#prerequisites).

## Simple Example

Deploy those two yaml files on your Kubernetes cluster in order to add a simple backend example, available through HTTP and TCP.

```yaml tab="namespace.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: whoami

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: whoami-server
  namespace: whoami

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: whoami-client
  namespace: whoami
```

```yaml tab="deployment.yaml"
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: whoami
  namespace: whoami
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: whoami
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: whoami
    spec:
      serviceAccount: whoami-server
      containers:
      - name: whoami
        image: containous/whoami:v1.4.0
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: whoami-tcp
  namespace: whoami
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: whoami-tcp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: whoami-tcp
    spec:
      serviceAccount: whoami-server
      containers:
      - name: whoami-tcp
        image: containous/whoamitcp:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whoami
  namespace: whoami
  labels:
    app: whoami
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: whoami
  selector:
    app: whoami

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whoami-tcp
  namespace: whoami
  labels:
    app: whoami-tcp
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      name: whoami-tcp
  selector:
    app: whoami-tcp

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: whoami-client
  namespace: whoami
spec:
  serviceAccountName: whoami-client
  containers:
    - name: whoami-client
      image: giantswarm/tiny-tools:3.9
      command:
      - "sleep"
      - "3600"
```

You should now see the following when running `kubectl get all -n whoami`:

```text
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/whoami-client                1/1     Running   0          11s

deployment.apps/whoami-tcp   2         2         2            2           13s

replicaset.apps/whoami-tcp-7679bc465   2         2         2       13s
```

You should now be able to make direct requests on your `whoami` service through HTTP.

```bash tab="Command"
kubectl -n whoami exec whoami-client -- curl -s whoami.whoami.svc.cluster.local
```

```text tab="Expected Output"
Hostname: whoami-84bdf87956-gvbm8
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 5.6.7.8
RemoteAddr: 1.2.3.4:12345
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: whoami.whoami.svc.cluster.local
User-Agent: curl/7.64.0
Accept: */*
```

And through TCP, by executing the following `netcat` command and sending some data.

```bash tab="Command"
kubectl -n whoami exec -ti whoami-client -- nc whoami-tcp.whoami.svc.cluster.local 8080
my data
```

```text tab="Expected Output"
Received: my data
```

You can now install Maesh [by following this documentation](install.md) on your cluster.

Since Maesh is not intrusive, it has to be explicitly given access to services before it can be used. You can ensure that the HTTP endpoint of your service does not pass through Maesh since no `X-Forwarded-For` header should be added.

Now, in order to configure Maesh for your `whoami` service, you just need to update the `whoami` service specs, in order to add the appropriate annotations.

The HTTP service needs to have `maesh.containo.us/traffic-type: "http"` and the TCP service, `maesh.containo.us/traffic-type: "tcp"`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whoami
  namespace: whoami
  labels:
    app: whoami
  # These annotations enable Maesh for this service:
  annotations:
    maesh.containo.us/traffic-type: "http"
    maesh.containo.us/retry-attempts: "2"
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: whoami
  selector:
    app: whoami

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whoami-tcp
  namespace: whoami
  labels:
    app: whoami-tcp
  # These annotations enable Maesh for this service:
  annotations:
    maesh.containo.us/traffic-type: "tcp"
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      name: whoami-tcp
  selector:
    app: whoami-tcp

```

You should now be able to access your HTTP and TCP services through the Maesh endpoint:

```bash tab="Command"
kubectl -n whoami exec whoami-client -- curl -s whoami.whoami.maesh
```

```text tab="Expected Output"
Hostname: whoami-84bdf87956-gvbm8
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 5.6.7.8
RemoteAddr: 1.2.3.4:12345
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: whoami.whoami.svc.cluster.local
User-Agent: curl/7.64.0
Accept: */*
X-Forwarded-For: 3.4.5.6
```

## ACL Example

The [ACL mode](install.md#access-control-list) can be enabled when installing Maesh. Once activated, all traffic is forbidden unless explicitly authorized
using the SMI [TrafficTarget](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/apis/traffic-access/v1alpha1/traffic-access.md#traffictarget) resource. This example will present the configuration required to allow the client
pod to send traffic to the HTTP and TCP services defined in the previous example.

Each `TrafficTarget` defines that a set of source `ServiceAccount` is capable of sending traffic to a destination `ServiceAccount`. To authorize the `whoami-client` pod to send traffic to `whoami.whoami.maesh`, we need to
explicitly allow it to hit the pods exposed by the `whoami` service. 

```yaml
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPRouteGroup
metadata:
  name: http-everything
  namespace: whoami
matches:
- name: everything
  pathRegex: ".*"
  methods: ["*"]
---
kind: TrafficTarget
apiVersion: access.smi-spec.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: whatever
  namespace: whoami
destination:
  kind: ServiceAccount
  name: whoami-server
  namespace: whoami
  port: "80"
specs:
- kind: HTTPRouteGroup
  name: http-everything
  matches:
  - everything
sources:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: whoami-client
  namespace: whoami
```


Incoming traffic on a TCP service can also be authorized using a `TrafficTarget` and a `TCPRoute`.

```yaml
kind: TrafficTarget
apiVersion: access.smi-spec.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: api-service-target
  namespace: default
destination:
  kind: ServiceAccount
  name: api-service
  namespace: default
specs:
- kind: TCPRoute
  name: my-tcp-route
sources:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: my-other-service
  namespace: default
---
apiVersion: specs.smi-spec.io/v1alpha1
kind: TCPRoute
metadata:
  name: my-tcp-route
```
