# Migrations

Helm Chart
{: .subtitle }

## v2.1 to v3.0

### Traefik Mesh renaming

All existing resources have been renamed and prefixed by `traefik-mesh`. 
For example, the `maesh-controller`resource has been renamed to `traefik-mesh-controller`.

### Mesh Property Name

Inside the Traefik Mesh helm chart, the `mesh` property has been renamed to `proxy`.

### Image version

Since version `v1.4`, Traefik Mesh uses plain [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/) Docker image for proxies.
Therefore, to change the image version used for the controller, or the proxies you should use the `controller.image` and `proxy.image` options.

### Default Mode

The `mesh.defaultMode` option has been removed.
You should use the new `defaultMode` option to configure the default traffic mode.

## v2.0 to v2.1

### Default Mode

The `mesh.defaultMode` option has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.
You should use the new `defaultMode` option to configure the default traffic mode.

### Prometheus and Grafana services

Prior to version `v2.1`, when the Metrics chart is deployed, Prometheus and Grafana services are exposed by default through a `NodePort`.
For security reasons, those services are not exposed by default anymore. 
To expose them you should use the new `prometheus.service` and `grafana.service` options, more details in the corresponding [values.yaml](https://github.com/traefik/mesh-helm-chart/blob/8a7a193a1718129ad6e02ff313b219029d6daffe/mesh/charts/metrics/values.yaml).

## v1.x to v2.0

### Image version

Since version `v1.2`, [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/) is used as a library.
Therefore, the `controller.image` and `mesh.image` options have been removed.
You should use the new `image` option as described in the [documentation](../install.md#deploy-helm-chart).    

### Log Level

The `controller.logging.debug` and `mesh.logging` options have been removed.
You should use the new `controller.logLevel` and `mesh.logLevel` options to configure the logging level for the controller and proxies.

### SMI Mode

The `smi.enable` option has been deprecated and removed.
You should use the new and backward compatible ACL mode option as described in the [documentation](../install.md#access-control-list).
