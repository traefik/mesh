# Submitting Issues

We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/traefik/mesh/issues) to keep track of Traefik Mesh issues. 

The process of sorting and checking the issues requires a lot of work. To save us some time and get quicker feedback, 
be sure to follow the guidelines below.

!!! Important "Getting Help"
    The issue tracker is not a general support forum, but a place to report bugs and asks for new features.
    For end-user related support questions, use the [Traefik Mesh community forum](https://community.containo.us/c/maesh).

## Issue Title

The title must be short and descriptive. (~60 characters)

## Description

Follow the [issue template](https://github.com/traefik/mesh/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) as much as possible.

Explain in which context you encountered the issue.

Remain clear and concise.

Take time to polish the format of your message so we'll enjoy reading it and working on it. Help the readers focus on 
what matters, and help them understand the structure of your message (see the [Github Markdown Syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)).

## Feature Request

Remember, when asking for new features, they must be useful to the majority (and not only useful in edge case scenarios, or hack-like setups).

Do your best to explain what you're looking for, and why it would improve Traefik Mesh for everyone. 

## International English

Traefik Mesh maintainers/users are not all native English speakers, so if you sometimes feel that some messages sound rude, 
remember that it's probably a language barrier problem from someone willing to help you.
