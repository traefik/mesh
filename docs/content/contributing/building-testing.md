# Building and Testing

So you want to build your own Maesh binary from the sources? Let's see how.

## Building

To build Maesh from the sources you need either [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html), 
or [Go](https://github.com/golang/go). 

### With `Docker` and `make`

Maesh can be built from the sources by using the `make` command. This will create a binary for the Linux platform in 
the `dist` directory and a Docker image:

```bash
$ make
#[...]
Successfully tagged containous/maesh:latest
docker run --name=build -t "containous/maesh:latest" version
version:
 version     : 04789a3
 commit      : 04789a3
 build date  : 2020-04-09_10:24:49AM
 go version  : go1.14.1
 go compiler : gc
 platform    : linux/amd64
#[...]

$ ls dist/
maesh
``` 

!!! Note
    The default `make` target invokes the `clean`, `check`, `test` and `build` targets.

### With `Go`

Requirements:

- `Go` v1.14+
- Environment variable `GO111MODULE=on`

One your Go environment is set up, you can build Maesh from the sources by using the `go build` command. The Go compiler 
will build an executable for your platform.

```bash
$ go build -o dist/maesh cmd/maesh/*.go
$ ./dist/maesh version
version:
 version     : dev
 commit      : I don't remember exactly
 build date  : I don't remember exactly
 go version  : go1.14.1
 go compiler : gc
 platform    : darwin/amd64
```

## Testing

### With `Docker` and `make`

Run unit tests by using the `test` target:

```bash
$ make test
docker build --tag "containous/maesh:test" --target maker --build-arg="MAKE_TARGET=local-test" /home/user/maesh/
#[...]
--- PASS: TestBuildConfiguration (0.00s)
    --- PASS: TestBuildConfiguration/simple_configuration_build_with_HTTP_service (0.20s)
PASS

Successfully tagged containous/maesh:test
```

Run the integration tests by using the `test-integration` target. For development purposes, you can specify which tests 
to run by using the `TESTFLAGS` environment variable (only works with the `test-integration` target):

```bash
# Run every tests in the MyTest suite
$ TESTFLAGS="-check.f MyTestSuite" make test-integration

# Run the test "MyTest" in the MyTest suite
$ TESTFLAGS="-check.f MyTestSuite.MyTest" make test-integration

# Run every tests starting with "My", in the MyTest suite
$ TESTFLAGS="-check.f MyTestSuite.My" make test-integration

# Run every tests ending with "Test", in the MyTest suite
$ TESTFLAGS="-check.f MyTestSuite.*Test" make test-integration
```

### With `Go`

Run the unit tests by using the `go test` command:

```bash
$ go test -v ./...

?   	github.com/containous/maesh/pkg/signals	[no test files]
```

Run the integration tests in the `integration` directory by using the `go test ./integration -integration` command:

```bash
$ go test -v ./integration -integration -check.f HelmSuite
#[...]
OK: 2 passed
--- PASS: Test (161.20s)
PASS
ok  	github.com/containous/maesh/integration	162.695s
```

!!! Important
    Before running the integration tests, build the Maesh Docker image. Check out the [Building](#building) section for 
    more details.
