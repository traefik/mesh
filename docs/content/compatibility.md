# Compatibility

Traefik Mesh supports, [similar to Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions), at least the latest three minor versions of Kubernetes, therefore currently:

* 1.17
* 1.18
* 1.19

General functionality cannot be guaranteed for versions older than that. However, we expect it to work with Kubernetes down to 1.11 currently.
