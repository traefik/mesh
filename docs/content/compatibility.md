# Compatibility

Traefik Mesh supports, [similar to Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions), at least the latest three minor versions of Kubernetes, therefore currently:

* 1.21
* 1.22
* 1.23

General functionality cannot be guaranted for versions older than that. However, we expect it to work with Kubernetes down to 1.11 currently.

## Compatibility by Features

Some of Traefik Mesh's features are only supported on certain Kubernetes versions. 
Please see the table below.

| Features              | K8s 1.21 | K8s 1.22 | K8s 1.23 |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| General functionality | ✔        | ✔        | ✔        |
| Service Topology      | ✔        | -        | -        |

!!! warning "Service Topology"

    In Kubernetes `v1.22`, the experimental Service Topology feature was removed.
    Therefore, starting from Traefik Mesh `v1.4.5`, the support of this feature has been removed.

## SMI Specification support

Traefik Mesh is based on the latest version of the SMI specification:

| API Group          | API Version                                                                                                             |
